      "0": "Shortly after the Time of Troubles began the nomadic bandit tribes of the Calimshan desert were united under a single leader; a cruel and brutal giant of a man, the warlord Ixil Xaxsha. From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.\nRumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerun by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.\nIxil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach inside his opponents and hold them in place even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear... seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.\nThe warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.\nThough Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered."
